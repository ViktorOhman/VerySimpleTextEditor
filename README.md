# VerySimpleTextEditor
This is my second ever project. It took me around one evning to make this. Its very bear bones and simple. It also requires a few libraries and i made it in Pycharm. And like usual !WARNING! This tiny project is for messing around.
 
 !UPDATE! This code is now buggy and not working. If u want try to fix it
